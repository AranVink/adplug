Installation (Windows):
-----------------------
After extraction, load the project file "adplug.dsp" into the Visual C++ GUI
and build the project as usual with either Debug or Release configuration.

Installation (MS-DOS):
----------------------
After extraction, do in the extraction directory:

wmake /f makefile.wat

This should create the library. Copy it and all headers to your default
library and header locations and then do in the extraction directory:

make clean

or even:

make distclean

to remove all files created at compile time or even all eventually
additional created files.

Installation (Linux):
---------------------
After extraction, do in the extraction directory as normal user:

make

This should create the library in dynamically linkable form. If you prefer it
to be a static library, do as normal user:

make static

You can then do as superuser:

make install

to install the library and headers to the right paths. The library will
go to /usr/local/lib and the headers to /usr/include/adplug, by default.

After installing the files, you can additionally do as normal user:

make clean

or even:

make distclean

to remove all files created at compile time or even all eventually
additional created files.

Uninstallation (Linux):
-----------------------
Under Linux, it is possible to remove the library and headers from the
system, by doing as superuser:

make uninstall

This will remove the files from the default paths (/usr/local/lib and
/usr/include/adplug).

For other OSes, you have to remove the files manually.
