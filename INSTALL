Installation:
-------------
After extraction, do as normal user:

make

This should create the library in either dynamically or statically linkable
form, depending on the host OS.

The following defaults apply:

Host OS			Library
-------			-------
Linux			dynamic
Windows			dynamic
DOS			static

Under Linux, you can then do as superuser:

make install

to install the library and headers to the right paths. The library will
go to /usr/local/lib and the headers to /usr/include/adplug, by default. For
other OSes, you have to install the files manually.

After installing the files, you can additionally do as normal user:

make clean

or even:

make distclean

to remove all files created at compile time or even all eventually
additional created files.

Uninstallation:
---------------
Under Linux, it is possible to remove the library and headers from the
system, by doing as superuser:

make uninstall

This will remove the files from the default paths (/usr/local/lib and
/usr/include/adplug).

For other OSes, you have to remove the files manually.
