Installation (Windows):
-----------------------
If you are using Visual C++ load the project file "adplug.dsp" into the GUI
and build the project as usual with either Debug or Release configuration.

If you are using cygwin, refer to the linux installation.

Installation (MS-DOS):
----------------------
Just do:

wmake /f makefile.wat

This should create the library. Copy it and all headers to your default
library and header locations.

Installation (Linux):
---------------------
Do as normal user:

make

This should create the library in dynamically linkable form. If you prefer it
to be a static library, do as normal user:

make static

You can then do as superuser:

make install

to install the library and headers to your system. The library will go to
/usr/local/lib and the headers to /usr/local/include/adplug, by default.

Uninstallation (Linux):
-----------------------
Under Linux, it is possible to remove the library and headers from the
system, by doing as superuser:

make uninstall

For other OSes, you have to remove the files manually.
