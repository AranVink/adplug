Description:
------------
AdPlug is a free, multi-platform, hardware independent AdLib sound player
library, mainly written in C++. AdPlug plays sound data, originally created
for the AdLib (OPL2) audio board, on top of an OPL2 emulator or by using the
real hardware. No OPL2 chip is required for playback.

Supported platforms:
--------------------
AdPlug currently is tested to compile and run well on the following
platforms and compilers:

Hardware                Operating System        Compiler
--------                ----------------        --------
IBM-PC - x86            Windows XP              MS Visual C++ 6.0
                        MS-DOS 7.0              OpenWatcom 1.2
                        Linux 2.6.5             GCC 3.3.3
                        FreeBSD 4.7-STABLE      GCC 2.95.4
                        QNX 6.2.x               GCC 2.95.3
PPC - G4                MacOS X                 GCC 2.95.2
PPC - RS/6000           Linux 2.2               GCC 2.x
Alpha                   Linux 2.2               GCC 2.95.4
Sparc - Ultra60         Linux 2.4               GCC 2.95.4
Sparc - R220            SunOS 5.8               GCC 2.95.3
ARM                     Linux 2.4.19            GCC 3.3.2

This list only incorporates platforms on which this release of AdPlug has
been tested successfully. This and/or earlier versions of AdPlug may and did
run on a variety of other platforms as well. It just means they haven't been
explicitly tested for this release.

The library builds as dynamic and/or static link library, depending on
the facilities provided by the host OS. These are autodetected. On Windows,
using MSVC6, only a static link library is built right now.

The emulator license issue:
---------------------------
AdPlug uses MAME's fmopl OPL2 emulator. While this official distribution
includes an old LGPL'd version of the emulator, which was developed by
Tatsuyuki Satoh alone, who relicensed this version under the LGPL, there is
a patch available at:

http://www.informatik.uni-oldenburg.de/~dyna/adplug/

that replaces the old version by the latest version from the MAME source
distribution. The new version features improved emulation quality, but is
licensed under the MAME license, which restricts commercial redistribution.
