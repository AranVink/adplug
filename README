Description:
------------
AdPlug is a free, multi-platform, hardware independent AdLib sound player
library, mainly written in C++. AdPlug plays sound data, originally created
for the AdLib (OPL2) audio board, on top of an OPL2 emulator or by using the
real hardware. No OPL chip is required for playback.

Supported platforms:
--------------------
AdPlug currently is tested to compile and run well under the following
platforms and compilers:

Platform     Compiler(s)
--------     -----------
Windows      Visual C++ 6.0, cygwin
MS-DOS       WATCOM C/C++ 11.0
Linux        GCC 2.x, GCC 3.x
FreeBSD      GCC 2.x, GCC 3.x

The library builds as dynamic and/or static link library, depending on
the facilities provided by the host OS. These are autodetected. On Windows,
using VC6, only a static link library is built right now.

CVS and UNIX
------------
If you checked out from CVS and use UNIX, first run:

./autogen.sh

to generate the build cruft and get the configure script.

Supported formats:
------------------
AdPlug implements unique file replayers for each supported format in order to
achieve the best possible replay quality. Below is a list of all currently
supported file formats along with information about possible replay issues.

may contain many replay issues, but are included for testing purposes anyway.

Known bugs and problems:
------------------------
Some files (especially SA2) will sound distorted through the emulator. This is
a well-known "problem" with software mixing, hearable when the composer plays
the same sound on multiple channels. Hardware mixing is unaffected by this
issue.
