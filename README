Description:
------------
AdPlug is a free, cross-platform, hardware independent AdLib sound player
library, mainly written in C++. AdPlug plays sound data, originally created
for the AdLib (OPL2) audio board, on top of an OPL2 emulator or by using the
real hardware. No OPL chip is required for playback.
