Description:
------------
AdPlug is a free, multi-platform, hardware independent AdLib sound player
library, mainly written in C++. AdPlug plays sound data, originally created
for the AdLib (OPL2) audio board, on top of an OPL2 emulator or by using the
real hardware. No OPL2 chip is required for playback.

Supported platforms:
--------------------
AdPlug currently is tested to compile and run well under the following
platforms and compilers:

Hardware		Platform		Compiler
--------		--------		--------
IBM-PC			Win32			MS Visual C++ 6.0
						cygwin
                        MS-DOS                  Watcom C/C++ 11.0c
						OpenWatcom 0.8.5
			Linux 2.2		GCC 2.x
			Linux 2.4		GCC 2.x
						GCC 3.x
			FreeBSD 4.7-RC		GCC 2.x
						GCC 3.x
PPC - G4		MacOS X			GCC 2.x
PPC - RS/6000		Linux 2.2		GCC 2.x
Alpha			Linux 2.4		GCC 2.x
Sparc - Ultra60		Linux 2.4		GCC 2.x
Sparc - R220		SunOS 5.8		GCC 2.x

The library builds as dynamic and/or static link library, depending on
the facilities provided by the host OS. These are autodetected. On Windows,
using VC6, only a static link library is built right now.
