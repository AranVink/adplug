Description:
------------
AdPlug is a free, multi-platform, hardware independent AdLib sound player
library, mainly written in C++. AdPlug plays sound data, originally created
for the AdLib (OPL2) audio board, on top of an OPL2 emulator or by using the
real hardware. No OPL2 chip is required for playback.

Supported platforms:
--------------------
AdPlug currently is tested to compile and run well under the following
platforms and compilers:

Hardware		Platform		Compiler
--------		--------		--------
IBM-PC			Win32			MS Visual C++ 6.0
						cygwin
			MS-DOS			Watcom C/C++ 11.x
			Linux 2.2		GCC 2.x
			Linux 2.4		GCC 2.x
						GCC 3.x
			FreeBSD 4.7-RC		GCC 2.x
						GCC 3.x
PPC - G4		MacOS X			GCC 2.x
PPC - RS/6000		Linux 2.2		GCC 2.x
Alpha			Linux 2.4		GCC 2.x
Sparc - Ultra60		Linux 2.4		GCC 2.x
Sparc - R220		SunOS 5.8		GCC 2.x

The library builds as dynamic and/or static link library, depending on
the facilities provided by the host OS. These are autodetected. On Windows,
using VC6, only a static link library is built right now.

Supported formats:
------------------
AdPlug implements unique file replayers for each supported format in order to
achieve the best possible replay quality. Below is a list of all currently
supported file formats along with information about possible replay issues.

Known bugs and problems:
------------------------
Some files (especially SA2) may sound distorted through the emulator. This is
a well-known "problem" with software mixing, hearable when the composer plays
the same sound on multiple channels. Hardware mixing is unaffected by this
issue.
