Unfinished release goals for version 2.1:
-----------------------------------------
- New players:
  - Palladix file format [dynamite]

- Fix amd.cpp loader to play Skyrunner's files correctly [dynamite]
  - Volume conversion is wrong in amd.cpp loader

- Fix platform-dependent players:
  - D00 [dynamite]
    - Problem is that all sections of the file at least need to be loaded
      separateley, as at least Sparc needs word-aligned section starts.

- Convert players to dual-OPL2/OPL3 support:
  - A2M

General to do items:
--------------------
- Add new Protracker loaders:
  - MTR: Arkham Master Tracker [riven-mage]

- Add some index entries to documentation. [dynamite]

- Split out endian-unclean players of the main test case and make them
  another one. [dynamite]
