yourself.

AdPlug To Do List:
------------------
- Add rhythm mode support to CMF player (inside mid.cpp).

- Add new Protracker loaders:
	- MTR: Arkham Master Tracker [riven-mage]
	- LDS: Loudness

- Maybe add an AM_PATH_ADPLUG aclocal defun to the UNIX build. [dynamite]

- Reimplement struct allplayers[] to also include entries for format ID,
  file extension, format description (which is currently returned from the
  CPlayer::gettype() method), enable/disable flag, and maybe also a flag
  that indicates if a file extension check is to be performed before the
  player's load method can be called. [dynamite]

- Construct a class to handle the allplayers[] struct and maybe include the
  struct itself inside the class. Maybe just extend CAdPlug. [dynamite]

- Move struct allplayers[] and VERSION #define out of adplug.cpp and inside
  a new file players.h or similar. [dynamite]

- Implement 'autoproject', an automake-like program that generates a MSVC6
  .dsp file from Makefile.am. [dynamite]

- Write user documentation. [dynamite]
