To Do List:
-----------
- Add missing features to A2M loader and/or Protracker player.

- Reimplement format detection and player initialization scheme in adplug.cpp.
Some kind of a list of the players would be feasible. Using a static
initialization method inside the players' interface.

- Add more CRC values to IMF file detection in imfcrc.h.

- Get LOUDNESS support to work.

- Fix up missing stuff in MIDI player.

- Protracker player:
	- Portamento: If target note is key-off, slide to last real note
	instead.

- Write install.win32
