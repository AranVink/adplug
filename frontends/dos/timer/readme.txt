Timer Lib 1.0

Introduction

	This is a complete rip of the timer routines used by
Cubic's OpenCP. I found that these are the most complete
and useable timer routines, there are for WATCOM C.

	Including the ability to setup an interrupt routine
in protected mode with a defineable stack size and the lib
runs flawlessly in a Win95 DOS Box.

	I ripped the necessary code out of the OpenCP 2.6.0
source distribution and made a nice lil' lib for easy usage.
