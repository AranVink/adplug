Known bugs and problems:
------------------------
- Some files (especially SA2) may sound distorted through the emulator. This is
  a well-known "problem" with software mixing, hearable when the composer plays
  the same sound on multiple channels. Hardware mixing is unaffected by this
  issue.

- Some players are still not endian-clean and may crash on big endian
  architectures.
