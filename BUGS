Known bugs and problems:
------------------------
- Some files (especially SA2) may sound distorted through the emulator. This is
  a well-known "problem" with software mixing, hearable when the composer plays
  the same sound on multiple channels. Hardware mixing is unaffected by this
  issue.

- Some players are still not endian-clean and may crash on big endian
  architectures.

Excuses for non-working players on certain architectures:
---------------------------------------------------------
SunOS 5.9 (Solaris) on x86:
- Adlib Visual Composer (rol.cpp): Here seems to be some problems with the
  libstdc++ implementation, at least on my test machine. gdb reports an
  "incomplete type" error when accessing the Vectors in CVoiceData in
  method CrolPlayer::UpdateVoice(). The code compiles well though, which is
  kind of strange.
